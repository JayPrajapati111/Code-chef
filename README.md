Competitive Programming has now become one of the most sought out skills in a programmer. It has ignited the sports of programming and also boosted the interest of millions of coders around the world. Among various sites which promote competitive programming, CodeChef has emerged to be one of the most popular sites. We will be discussing how you can compete in your first coding contest in CodeChef in this article.

CodeChef is an Indian origin coding platform that provides huge learning opportunities through its regular coding contests. These contests are based on data structures and algorithms and attract thousands of participants worldwide to compete and secure CodeChef laddus and winning cash rewards.

arious types of problems are held by CodeChef every month regularly and each of the contests is of a different type. Each type of contest has 3 divisions of participants which are based on ranks. These ranks are determined by the participants’ previous performance in competition. To be rated you have to participate in at least one contest.

Long Challenge: It starts with a long challenge where the participants get around 10 days to solve 10 questions. These questions are based on simple maths to advanced algorithmic questions. Difficulty increases as you move from lower ratings to higher ratings. This round is generally for educational purpose where you get 10 days to research an algorithm and try to solve the question based on that.
 
Cook-Off: It consists of a 2.5-hour contest that has 6-7 questions based on data structures and algorithms. This round has a penalty for each wrong submission hence, making it difficult than the Long challenges.
 
Lunch Time: This involves a three-hour programming contest that tests your skills in maths, data structure and algorithms in depth.

This challenges are now dicontinued but Recently another contest known as the CodeChef starters has been introduced to help the third division rated coders boost their skills and move into the higher ratings.
